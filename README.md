_This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)._

You might find yourself [in a pickle](https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv/issues/675#issuecomment-357741260) when attempting to provide asynchronous json schema validation via the delightfully performant [AJV](https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv) for a [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) (CRA) app running in an Internet Explorer (IE) setting.

IE 11 [does not support async functions](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es2016plus/#test-async_functions) but AJV [provides optional transpilation](https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv#using-transpilers-with-asynchronous-validation-functions) of its generated validation code through [ajv-async](https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv-async), which uses [NoDent](https://github.com/MatAtBread/nodent).

After installing ajv-async and running your CRA app you will probably come across this error:

```
Failed to compile.

./node_modules/nodent/nodent.js
Module parse failed: Unexpected character '#' (1:0)
You may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type.
| #!/usr/bin/env node
| 
| 'use strict';
```

> You can reproduce this error for the app in this repository by importing `./validatorWithAjvAsync` as the `validator` within _`App.js`_.

Ok, no problem, you can just do what it says and write a Webpack loader of your own. Oh wait, ~~doing this the right way (no hacky code) would involve [ejecting from CRA](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/2608#issuecomment-311091522) and you may not want to do that~~ NoDent is a node program and can't run in the browser.

At this point, you have 3 options:
1. ~~Maintain a fork of CRA with a custom Webpack configuration.~~
2. ~~Eject from CRA and provide your custom or third-party Webpack loader.~~
3. Drop asyncronous validation in IE contexts.
> You can test this by removing `$async: true` from _`schema.json`_.
4. Use an alternate transpilation method through the `processCode` option (see [AJV Options](https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv#options)).
> Transpilation can be handled by [babel-standalone](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages/babel-standalone). You can test it by importing `./validatorWithBabel` as the `validator` within _`App.js`_. **This solution only serves as a demonstration and does not include an environment check; it will run as-is on all browsers.**
5. If your schemas are static, you can use the [ajv-cli](https://github.com/jessedc/ajv-cli#compile-schemas) to generate the validation function, which CRA will compile, eliminating the need for a separate transpiler. (See [this issue](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/3811#issuecomment-357809728)).
> _`./validateCompiled.js`_ was generated by running `npm run ajv-compile`. Generating validation functions is still a BETA feature of ajv-cli; changes have been made to the generated code. These changes include disabling eslint and using es6 exports. You can import it within _`App.js`_ to test solution 5.
